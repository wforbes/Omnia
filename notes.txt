2022 Ideas
Story Mode
- Create a new save file
- Customize a player appearance, name and basics to begin using save file
- Playing a save file runs the game on a scripted story mode which progresses through phases
- Saving the game persists all the progress in the story script and gameplay

Sandbox Mode
- Move the current game state engine options into a Sandbox menu
- Modify the game states
- Game engines run from Sandbox menu in the format that they exist with now, as an open world t

Developer Mode
- Move the current game state engine options into a developer menu
