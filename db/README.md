Added the sqlite db file here to be included in the repo.

To work with it, create and move it to "C:\sqlite\db\" or update the path string called out in
 source file /db/Database.java to a directory of your choosing on your dev machine.

I'm expecting to convert this to an in-memory database soon,
but this will require a database setup step on Overworld Game State...
and it's like 2AM right now... and I'm kinda tired... so it's being put off for now!
