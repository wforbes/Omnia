# Omnia

This is a Role Playing Game made so that I can practice Java, experiment with ideas, and have fun.

(Last updated: 10/23/2019)

## Project Thesis:

**TLDR**: The goal of Omnia is to focus heavily on the mechanics/systems, story-lines/universe, and underlying 
foundations of what makes the game work. This way, no matter the device used to play it or the era it's being played 
in - it can provide a unique and captivating experience to the player.

*The Problem*<br>
So often I've played great games that look amazing, have many awesome features, and really play well... but I feel they 
lack a depth of **mechanics** and **story-line**.

In these games much of the effort is put toward making the graphics shine, use all the popular play paradigms 
(battle-royale, loot farming, level grinding, etc.) yet meanwhile the experience is still limited by a shallow item 
system, a cookie cutter stats system, and a rather boring predictable level/skill progression. Not to mention a 
story-line and set of dialogue that reads like the back of a foreign cereal box from 1972.

*Items Systems*<br>
 Throughout most role-playing games you collect items. Many of these items are armor or gear you wear, weapons or 
 powerful implements you hold or store in your inventory. As interesting as the names or lore behind them may be; 
 they're usually color-coded (green, blue, purple, orange, gold, etc.), which equate to the quality of the item, 
 the item's power. You don't ever need to even know the exact stats on the item... you just know it's good because 
 of the color. This classification system is over a decade old now. The truth is, much of the time you will trash or 
 sell anything that isn't the highest possible quality. The rarity or set random chance of obtaining a high quality 
 item is simply just a dice roll, where you have XX percent chance of obtaining it and so you just mindlessly farm 
 what drops it until you get it. You just do the quest enough times and you'll achieve your legendary rare orange 
 quality sword of swordiness... and then what? Just more farming for a better one.
 
 *Stats Systems*<br>
 So often, in games like these, the values of your stats, health, mana, level, etc. all increase as you move through 
 the game - only to reach a huge number that doesn't really change the game experience very much. Often the only 
 difference between level 1 and level 100 is that you got a bunch of 'legendary' items, extra skills, and encounters 
 may take longer or involve more steps.<br>
 *What did you learn along the way? What can you take with you and use in other areas in your life?*
 
 *Level/Skills Systems*<br>
 ..(in progress)
 
 I envision a type of game where your character reacts to situations in a nuanced way. You enter into combat and you're 
 given more interesting and dynamic ways on how to react. When your character progresses, so do you as a person. You 
 learn things from the game that shape how you develop as a person and you may even learn useful job skills from it 
 that help you in life. Part educational, part introspective, part dynamically inter-related. Your sword is powerful 
 because it adjusts your characters mind and body in deeper ways that just raising your Strength statistic by 5. 
 When you fight you see openings and opportunities to strike because of what you've learned from the game. You create 
 items successfully when performing a tradeskill because you let the blade temper and swung the hammer differently that 
 time, using a new ingredient which chemically altered the blade.
 
 It's a lofty vision, not yet defined in concrete ways which I personally quest for while writing this software.
 
 My main goal is to help provide real **value** to the player of the game.

### Todo List
*[X] Resurrect [an old game engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIMeRYfil7c&list=PLRjjchumlJl2LIs1esk_C9RPvlEf2GOLb) I worked on in 2013 based loosely on two very old tutorials:
    *[X] Find code from following [Java 2D Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE7ezYCTPe4&list=PL8CAB66181A502179) by vanZeben
    *[X] Find code from following [Java 2D Game Programming Platformer Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo&list=PL-2t7SM0vDfcIedoMIghzzgQqZq45jYGv) by ForeignGuyMike
    
*[ ] **Begin a Game Design Document**
    *[ ] Brainstorm on the following topics:
        *[ ] **Define Prototype Complete**: What should the user be able to do on the game for the 'prototype' status
        to be completel and 'alpha' status to begin.
        *[ ] **Define Full Scope**: Outline the full scope of the project to be ready for production (3 year timeframe)
        *[ ] **Mechanics**: Get a full list of how the mechanics of the game will work and their purpose

## Omnia Software License
I'm not a license expert so please DM me with corrections but I think it's fair that, if you're going to use this code and work on this game 
on your own and turn it into something of your own (which you're free to do); I should get some credit for contributing to it. That's 
the idea behind using the BSD 4-Clause license for this work. I expect the type of license used on this project will change as the project 
continues and may at some point become proprietary, but this won't happen soon. If there's anything I can do to help your work in expanding 
your version of this work, please DM me. Thanks!
