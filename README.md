# Omnia

This is a Role Playing Game made so that I can practice Java, experiment with ideas, and have fun.

(Last updated: 10/23/2019)

## Project Thesis:

**TLDR**: The goal of Omnia is to focus heavily on the mechanics/systems, story-lines/universe, and underlying 
foundations of what makes the game work on a foundational level. This way, no matter the device used to play it 
or the era it's being played in - it can provide a unique and captivating experience to the player.
 
I envision a type of game where your character reacts, and by extension the player must react, to situations in 
a nuanced way. You enter into combat and you're given more interesting and dynamic ways on how to react than other 
games. When your character progresses, so do you as a person. You learn things from the game that shape how you 
develop as a person. You may even learn useful job skills from it that help you in life. Part educational, part 
introspective, part dynamically inter-related. Your sword is powerful because it adjusts your characters mind and 
body in deeper ways than just raising your Strength statistic by 5. When you fight you see openings and opportunities 
to strike because of what you've learned from the game. You create items successfully when performing a tradeskill 
because you let the blade temper just right and swung the anvil hammer differently that time, using a new ingredient 
which chemically altered the blade.
 
It's a lofty vision, not yet defined in concrete ways which I personally quest for while writing this software.
 
My main goal is to help provide real **value** to the player of the game, not just a shiny cardboard cutout with 
good graphics.

### Todo List
* [x] Resurrect [an old game engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIMeRYfil7c&list=PLRjjchumlJl2LIs1esk_C9RPvlEf2GOLb) I worked on in 2013 based loosely on two very old tutorials:
    * [x] Find my code based on [Java 2D Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE7ezYCTPe4&list=PL8CAB66181A502179) by vanZeben
    * [x] Find my code based on [Java 2D Game Programming Platformer Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzhgsVaiSo&list=PL-2t7SM0vDfcIedoMIghzzgQqZq45jYGv) by ForeignGuyMike
    
* [ ] **Begin a Game Design Document**
    * [ ] Brainstorm on the following topics:
        * [ ] **Define Prototype Complete**: What should the user be able to do on the game for the 'prototype' status
        to be complete and 'alpha' status to begin.
        * [ ] **Define Full Scope**: Outline the full scope of the project to be ready for production (3 year timeframe)
        * [ ] **Mechanics**: Start a list of how the mechanics of the prototype game will work and their purpose.
        * [ ] **Storyline**: Define the characters and setting, the journey they go on, the problems they need to solve
        * [ ] **Education**: Pull together some basic things that the game should teach in it's educational content

## Omnia Software License
I'm not a license expert so please DM me with corrections but I think it's fair that, if you're going to use this code and work on this game 
on your own and turn it into something of your own (which you're free to do); I should get some credit for contributing to it. That's 
the idea behind using the BSD 4-Clause license for this work. I expect the type of license used on this project will change as the project 
continues and may at some point become proprietary, but this won't happen soon. If there's anything I can do to help your work in expanding 
your version of this work, please DM me. Thanks!
